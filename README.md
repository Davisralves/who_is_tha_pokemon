## What was developed ?
Was developed a game that draws a pokemon and expects the player to guess it's name based on the pokemon's weight, height and type. There is also a pokedex where you can check all pokemons, edit, delete and add new ones. I used [poke_api](https://pokeapi.co/) as a base and from it then I create a mysql database, a CRUD API to store the pokemons and be the bridge between applications such as front-end, database and api of the pokemons using docker.
